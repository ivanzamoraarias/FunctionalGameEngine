# FunctionalGameEngine
Online game engine based on Scala languaje

This project aims to send real time objects to game clients. 
Logic must be inside the server engine. 
Scripts are intended to load by each instance.

I know every developer want to create its own classes and objects. So you can extend from the GameObject class for every type that you are thinking about. 

The goal is to use the Property centric model for every object here, so keep in mind that each object will have its own id.
